UDP Overlay Network
Authors: Gibson Phillips and Seth Frank

This is a partially incomplete attempt at making a UDP overlay network using IPv4 protocols. 

In this network there are host endpoints and routers. The packet sent will have a destination indicated by the IPv4 overlay header and forwarded through the network of routers until it reaches the appropriate endpoint.
